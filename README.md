# Hugh, cor!

Hugh, cor! is a minimal blog theme for [hugo](https://gohugo.io). The theme is based on [Hemingway2](https://gitlab.com/beli3ver/hemingway2).

This is a minimal fork of [mgjohansen's hucore](https://github.com/mgjohansen/hucore). I have changed the name to avoid any potential confusion.
